# YouTube Video Listing

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a YouTube-style video listing page that fetches and displays videos from the FreeAPI YouTube endpoint.

## Features

- **Fetch and Display Videos**: Retrieve a list of YouTube videos from the API and display them on the webpage.
- **Video Thumbnails, Titles, and Channel Names**: Display each video’s thumbnail, title, and channel name.
- **Click to Open Video**: Clicking on a video takes the user to the video’s YouTube page.
- **Search Bar for Filtering**: Implement a search bar to filter videos based on their title or tags (without making additional API calls).
- **Grid Layout for Display**: Use a grid layout to display videos in a responsive and visually appealing manner.

## API Endpoint
- **Endpoint URL**: `https://api.freeapi.app/api/v1/public/youtube/videos`
- **Method**: GET

For detailed API documentation, refer to the [FreeAPI YouTube API Guide](https://freeapi.hashnode.space/api-guide/apireference/getYoutubeVideos).
